            If you click the link below, you will be brought to a page 
            that will ask you to login with your Google credentials. This
            app will request access to your Google profile. After authorization,
            you will be added into our database as a beekeeper. A page will display 
            your first and last name along with a JWT that can be used to
            authenticate with the protected endpoints at /hives.
